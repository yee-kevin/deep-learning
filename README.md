Using sklearn Support Vector Classification (SVC) to implement a linear SVM. The dataset used is imageclef2011.

#### 2. HW2 [Code] - Part 1 (Broadcasting), Part 2 (k-means)
Part 1 (Broadcasting) -  Comparing time measurements using double for-loops, numpy broadcasting and pytorch cpu  
Part 2 (k-means) - Creating a pytorch k-means algorithm  

#### 3. HW3 [Code] - Part 1 (SGD for logistic regression in Pytorch), Part 2 (Fully connected neural net in Pytorch)  
Part 1 - Implement SGD for logistic regression using a self generated dataset.  
Part 2 - Implement a fully connected neural network (FCNN) using the FashionMNIST dataset.  

#### 4. HW4 [Code] - Part 1 (Data augmentation), Part 2 (Finetuning neural network)  
Part 1 (Data Augmentation) - center crop testing, 5-crop testing, varying input size
